# Story 2.5: Automated Version Display & History System

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** website owner (david@ideasmen.com.au),
**I want** an automated version tracking and display system that shows the current website version with historical navigation capabilities,
**so that** I can track deployment history, understand what changes were made, and easily navigate between different versions of the website

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Automated Version Increment**: Every successful CI deployment to main branch automatically increments the version using semantic versioning based on conventional commit message parsing (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)

2. **Version Manifest System**: A machine-readable JSON file (`public/version-manifest.json`) is created and updated automatically during CI/CD pipeline containing version, commit hash, timestamp, description, and commit URL

3. **Historical Git Analysis Script**: Create a rerunnable bootstrap script that analyzes existing commit history using conventional commit patterns, generates semantic versions for historical commits, and creates/updates the initial version manifest. Script must be repository-agnostic and handle different git histories gracefully

4. **UI Display Component**: A footer indicator (similar to existing log tracing indicator) displays the current version and provides click-to-expand functionality showing version history modal/dropdown with navigation for the last 20 versions

5. **New Version Flash Notification**: When a new version is detected (compared to local storage), display a prominent but non-intrusive flash/highlight notification to draw attention to the version change, with persistence to avoid repeated flashing

6. **GitHub Integration**: Each version entry includes direct links to the corresponding GitHub commit for easy reference and troubleshooting

7. **Access Control**: Version display and history are only visible when the authenticated user email matches david@ideasmen.com.au using the existing Convex auth system

8. **Navigation Controls**: Previous/Next version browsing capability within the version history interface

9. **Template Reusability**: Code architecture designed for template reuse where versioning logic and components can be copied to other applications, while each application maintains its own version manifest based on its specific commit history and development lifecycle

## Estimation & Planning

### Story Points

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Based on Stories 1.6 (CI/CD Pipeline) and 2.4 (Theme Toggle), this story builds on established patterns for CI automation and footer component integration.

### Data Models

**Version Manifest Schema** [Source: requirements analysis]:

```typescript
interface VersionManifest {
  versions: Array<{
    version: string; // Semantic version (e.g., "1.2.3")
    commitHash: string; // Full Git commit SHA
    timestamp: number; // Unix timestamp
    description: string; // Commit message or derived description
    commitUrl: string; // GitHub commit URL
  }>;
  current: string; // Current version string
  lastUpdated: number; // Manifest update timestamp
}
```

### API Specifications

**Convex Authentication Check** [Source: docs/architecture/components.md]:

- Function: `auth.verifyOwnerAccess`
- Purpose: Verify user email matches david@ideasmen.com.au
- Returns: Boolean indicating access permission
- Integration: Use existing BetterAuth + Convex adapter pattern

### Component Specifications

**VersionIndicator Component** [Source: docs/architecture/components.md + existing footer patterns]:

- Location: `apps/web/components/dev/VersionIndicator.tsx`
- Props: None (fetches data internally)
- State: Modal open/closed, version history, current version
- Styling: Match existing footer indicator patterns from logging system
- Behavior: Click to expand history, Previous/Next navigation

### File Locations

**Based on Project Structure** [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]:

- **Bootstrap Script**: `scripts/bootstrap-version-history.sh` (new, standalone)
- **CI Script**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (modify existing)
- **Version Logic**: `scripts/version-increment.sh` (new)
- **Component**: `apps/web/components/dev/VersionIndicator.tsx`
- **Flash Notification**: `apps/web/components/dev/VersionFlashNotification.tsx`
- **Convex Function**: `apps/convex/auth.ts` (add verifyOwnerAccess)
- **Static Asset**: `apps/web/public/version-manifest.json`
- **Utilities**: `apps/web/lib/version-utils.ts`
- **Local Storage**: `apps/web/lib/version-storage.ts`
- **Template Docs**: `docs/template-usage/version-tracking-integration.md`
- **Script Config**: `scripts/version-config.json` (new, for bootstrap customization)

### Testing Requirements

**Based on Test Strategy** [Source: docs/testing/technical/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:

- **Unit Tests**: Version increment logic, component behavior, utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: CI/CD pipeline automation, Convex auth integration
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflow from deployment to version display
- **Mocking**: GitHub API, Convex auth, static asset fetching
- **Coverage Target**: 85%+ statements for new code

### Technical Constraints

**CI/CD Integration** [Source: docs/architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md]:

- Must integrate with existing GitHub Actions workflow
- Use conventional commit message parsing (feat:, fix:, docs:)
- Maintain compatibility with Cloudflare Pages deployment
- Ensure version manifest is included in static build output

**Historical Analysis Script Requirements**:

- Bootstrap script must be completely standalone and rerunnable
- Handle different git repository structures and commit patterns gracefully
- Configurable depth limits and starting version points for different use cases
- Idempotent operation - safe to run multiple times without data corruption
- Repository-agnostic design for template reuse across different projects
- Clear error messages and validation for edge cases (empty repos, non-git directories)
- Deterministic version assignment based solely on git history analysis

**Template Reusability Constraints**:

- Code must be completely decoupled from specific application context
- Configuration must be externalized for easy template adoption
- Version manifest schema must be application-agnostic

**Performance Considerations**:

- Version manifest should be minimal size (max 20 versions)
- Lazy load version history modal to avoid bundle bloat
- Cache version data appropriately to prevent excessive API calls
- Flash notification must not impact page load performance
- Local storage operations must be optimized for frequency of access

### Pattern Validation

**Established Patterns to Follow**:

- **CI/CD Automation**: Follow existing pipeline patterns from Story 1.6
- **Footer Components**: Match styling and behavior of existing logging indicators
- **Convex Integration**: Use established auth patterns from Story 1.5
- **Component Structure**: Follow ShadCN UI component patterns from Story 2.1

### Testing Standards

**Test File Locations** [Source: docs/testing/technical/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:

- **Component Tests**: `tests/web/components/dev/VersionIndicator.test.tsx`
- **Utility Tests**: `tests/web/lib/version-utils.test.ts`
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/web/integration/version-tracking.test.ts`
- **CI Tests**: Include CI script validation in pipeline

**Testing Frameworks**: Jest + React Testing Library for components, Playwright for E2E
**Mocking Strategy**: Mock GitHub API, Convex client, static asset fetching
