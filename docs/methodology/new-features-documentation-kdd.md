# New Features Documentation KDD

**Knowledge Discovery Document (KDD)** - Feature Documentation System for Template Repositories

## Problem Statement

When developing template repositories, there's a critical need to track and document new features added through story-driven development. Other repositories that want to adopt specific features need clear documentation of:

- What functionality was actually implemented
- Which files were created or modified
- How to extract and integrate the feature
- The original story context and requirements

Without systematic feature documentation, knowledge transfer between repositories becomes inefficient and error-prone.

## Knowledge Discovery

### Context and Background

**Template Repository Pattern**: This repository serves as a Next.js + Convex + AI template that other projects can extend or extract features from.

**Story-Driven Development**: Features are implemented through structured stories (Epic 3: Resilient Real-time Logging ‚Üí Story 3.6: Redis Data Sync & Legacy Code Migration).

**Cross-Repository Integration Need**: Teams want to selectively adopt features from this template without full duplication.

### Current Documentation Gap

**Existing Documentation Structure**:
- `docs/template-development/stories/` - Story specifications and implementation details
- `docs/architecture/` - Technical architecture components
- `docs/methodology/` - Development methodologies

**Missing Element**: No centralized feature catalog that maps completed functionality to actual file changes.

### Requirements Discovered

1. **Feature Catalog**: Central registry of implemented features with file manifests
2. **Implementation Tracking**: Clear mapping between story requirements and actual code
3. **Cross-Repository Adoption**: Documentation format that supports feature extraction
4. **Maintenance Integration**: Workflow for updating feature docs during development

## Solution Architecture

### New Features Documentation System

**Core Concept**: `docs/new-features/` directory containing feature-specific documentation files.

**Documentation Structure**:
```
docs/new-features/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md                     # Feature catalog and navigation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {feature-name}.md            # Individual feature documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-template.md      # Standardized template for new features
```

**Feature Documentation Format**:
```markdown
# Feature Name (Story X.Y)

**Epic**: [Link to Epic]

## New Features Added
- Bullet points of actual functionality implemented

## Files Added/Modified
### üÜï New Files
- Complete file paths with brief descriptions

### üìù Modified Files  
- Complete file paths with modification descriptions

## Technical Impact
- Quantified changes (files changed, insertions, etc.)

## Key Benefits
- User-facing value delivered
```

### Integration with Development Workflow

**Story Completion Process**:
1. Implement story requirements
2. Document feature in `docs/new-features/{feature-name}.md`
3. Update `docs/new-features/index.md` with new feature entry
4. Reference in CLAUDE.md for AI agent awareness

**KDD Application**:
- **Knowledge**: What features exist and how they're implemented
- **Discovery**: File manifests enable feature extraction
- **Documentation**: Standardized format for consistent documentation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Feature Documentation Standards

**Naming Convention**: Use descriptive kebab-case names matching functionality
- `admin-logging-system.md` (not `story-3-6.md`)
- `user-authentication.md` (not `auth-feature.md`)

**Content Requirements**:
- **Feature Description**: What was actually built (not planned)
- **File Manifest**: Complete list of new/modified files
- **Technical Impact**: Quantified changes and integration points
- **Benefits**: User-facing value delivered

**Epic/Story References**: Link back to original requirements but focus on implementation reality.

### Cross-Repository Adoption Workflow

**Feature Extraction Process**:
1. Browse `docs/new-features/index.md` to find desired functionality
2. Review feature documentation for file manifest
3. Copy identified files to target repository
4. Adapt configuration and dependencies as documented
5. Test integration and adapt to target environment

**Dependency Documentation**: Each feature should list external dependencies and configuration requirements.

### Maintenance Integration

**During Story Development**:
- Create feature documentation as part of Definition of Done
- Update feature docs when modifying existing features
- Maintain file manifests as single source of truth

**Version Control**: Feature docs committed with implementation changes to maintain synchronization.

### AI Agent Workflow

**New Features Documentation Protocol**:
```markdown
## New Features Documentation

When completing stories or implementing features:

1. **Create Feature Documentation**: Add file to `docs/new-features/{feature-name}.md`
2. **Update Feature Index**: Add entry to `docs/new-features/index.md`
3. **File Manifest Accuracy**: Ensure all new/modified files are documented
4. **Cross-Repository Value**: Focus on information needed for feature adoption

**Template Location**: Use `docs/new-features/templates/feature-template.md` for consistency.
```

### Documentation First Approach

**Before Creating**: Check if feature documentation template or similar patterns exist
**During Implementation**: Maintain awareness of files being modified for manifest
**After Completion**: Document what was actually built (not what was planned)

## Success Metrics

### Documentation Quality
- ‚úÖ Each feature has complete file manifest
- ‚úÖ Benefits clearly articulated for adoption decisions
- ‚úÖ Technical impact quantified (files, insertions, complexity)
- ‚úÖ Cross-repository adoption workflow validated

### Repository Value
- ‚úÖ Features can be extracted without full repository knowledge
- ‚úÖ Implementation details discoverable without code archaeology
- ‚úÖ Template repository serves as feature library for teams

### Developer Experience
- ‚úÖ Feature documentation creation integrated into story completion
- ‚úÖ AI agents understand and maintain feature documentation
- ‚úÖ Knowledge transfer between repositories streamlined

## Implementation Notes

**First Feature**: Admin Logging System (Story 3.6) serves as proof of concept
**Template Evolution**: Documentation format will evolve based on usage patterns
**Integration Patterns**: Focus on extractable features vs monolithic template adoption

## Lessons Learned

**Documentation Timing**: Creating feature docs immediately after implementation ensures accuracy
**File Manifest Importance**: Complete file lists are crucial for successful feature extraction
**Story vs Feature Focus**: Feature docs should emphasize what was built, not development process
