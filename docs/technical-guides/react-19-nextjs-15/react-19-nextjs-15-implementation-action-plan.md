## Pre-Implementation Checklist

### Environment Validation

- [ ] **Current Environment Sync**: Verify `.env.source-of-truth.local` + `scripts/sync-env.js` working
- [ ] **Git Status**: Clean working directory with all changes committed
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: Current Cloudflare Pages deployment preserved for rollback
- [ ] **Domain Access**: Cloudflare account permissions for custom domain management

### Tool Requirements

- [ ] **Node.js**: Version 18+ (verify with `node --version`)
- [ ] **Wrangler CLI**: Install globally with `npm install -g wrangler`
- [ ] **Cloudflare Auth**: `wrangler auth login` completed
- [ ] **Development Tools**: IDE with TypeScript support

### Documentation Setup

- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Create `docs/react-19-implementation-audit/` directory
- [ ] **Timeline Tracking**: Prepare master log for all changes
- [ ] **Configuration Backup**: Document current settings before changes

## Phase 1: React 19 + Next.js 15 Upgrade

### Step 1.1: Dependency Upgrade

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/starter-nextjs-convex-ai

# Upgrade core dependencies (use legacy peer deps for compatibility)
npm install react@19.0.0 react-dom@19.0.0 next@15.1.0 --legacy-peer-deps

# Update TypeScript types
npm install @types/react@19.0.0 @types/react-dom@19.0.0 --save-dev --legacy-peer-deps

# Update package.json in packages/ui if exists
cd packages/ui
npm install react@19.0.0 react-dom@19.0.0 --legacy-peer-deps
cd ../..
```

**Audit Log Entry**: Document all version changes and any package conflicts encountered

### Step 1.2: TypeScript Compatibility Fixes

Expected changes needed:

- Update `ReactNode` type imports to handle new `bigint` inclusion
- Fix any `React.FC` usage (deprecated in React 19)
- Update component prop types for new React 19 patterns

**Test Command**: `bun run typecheck`

### Step 1.3: Third-Party Package Conflicts

Known potential conflicts:

- UI libraries (ShadCN components may need updates)
- Form libraries (react-hook-form compatibility)
- Authentication libraries (check BetterAuth React 19 support)

**Resolution Strategy**: Use `--legacy-peer-deps` for installation, document all conflicts

## Phase 2: OpenNext Cloudflare Workers Setup

### Step 2.1: OpenNext Adapter Installation

```bash
# Install OpenNext Cloudflare adapter
npm install @opennextjs/cloudflare --save-dev

# Verify installation
npx opennextjs --version
```

### Step 2.2: Wrangler Configuration

Create `wrangler.toml` in project root:

```toml
# wrangler.toml
name = "starter-nextjs-convex-ai"
main = ".worker-next/index.mjs"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

[build]
command = "npm run build && npx opennextjs build"

[env.production]
name = "starter-nextjs-convex-ai"
```

### Step 2.3: Environment Variables Sync

```bash
# Use existing sync system
npm run sync-env  # or however your sync script is triggered

# Verify environment variables in Cloudflare Workers dashboard
wrangler secret list
```

**Critical**: Ensure all secrets from `.env.source-of-truth.local` are properly synced to Workers

### Step 2.4: Next.js Configuration Update

Update `next.config.js`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Remove output: 'export' if present
  // Add any Workers-specific optimizations
  experimental: {
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['@convex/convex'],
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

## Phase 3: Local Development & Testing

### Step 3.1: Local Development Setup

```bash
# Test local development
npm run dev

# Verify React 19 features are available
# Check browser console for any errors
# Test form actions, use() hook if implemented
```

### Step 3.2: Workers Local Testing

```bash
# Build for Workers
npm run build
npx opennextjs build

# Test locally with Wrangler
wrangler dev

# Access via http://localhost:8787
# Test all major application features
```

### Step 3.3: Log Ingestion Worker Integration Test

**Critical Test**: Verify that log ingestion still works:

```bash
# Test browser â†’ main app â†’ log worker flow
# Verify Convex â†’ log worker communication
# Check Redis storage in log worker
```

**Expected**: No changes needed to log ingestion worker API contracts

## Phase 4: Workers Deployment

### Step 4.1: Initial Workers Deployment (Staging)

```bash
# Deploy to workers.dev subdomain first
wrangler deploy

# Test on https://starter-nextjs-convex-ai.[your-subdomain].workers.dev
# Verify all functionality before custom domain switch
```

### Step 4.2: Custom Domain Migration

**Infrastructure Change**: Direct cutover approach (downtime acceptable for PoC)

1. **Remove domain from Pages**:
   - Go to Cloudflare Pages dashboard
   - Remove custom domain from current Pages deployment
2. **Add domain to Workers**:
   - Go to Cloudflare Workers dashboard
   - Add custom domain to Workers deployment
   - Verify SSL certificate provisioning

3. **DNS Verification**:
   - Check DNS propagation: `dig yourdomain.com`
   - Test HTTPS certificate: `curl -I https://yourdomain.com`

### Step 4.3: Production Validation

```bash
# Test all major workflows on custom domain
# Verify log ingestion integration
# Check performance metrics
# Monitor error rates
```

## Phase 5: CI/CD Pipeline Updates

### Step 5.1: GitHub Actions Update

Update deployment workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- name: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
  uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3
  with:
    apiToken: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
    command: deploy
```

**Remove**: Any Pages-specific deployment steps
**Keep**: All testing and validation steps

### Step 5.2: Monitoring Updates

- Update health check URLs to Workers endpoints
- Configure Workers-specific monitoring alerts
- Update any external monitoring services

## Success Criteria & Validation

### Technical Success Criteria

- [ ] **React 19 Features Available**: Actions, use() hook, optimistic UI accessible
- [ ] **Application Functionality**: All existing features working on Workers
- [ ] **Log Integration**: Log ingestion worker communication maintained
- [ ] **Performance**: Response times comparable or better than Pages
- [ ] **SSL & Security**: HTTPS working, security headers configured

### Business Success Criteria

- [ ] **Infrastructure Maintained**: Still on preferred Cloudflare platform
- [ ] **Cost Effective**: Workers pricing within acceptable range
- [ ] **Development Experience**: Team comfortable with new deployment process

## Rollback Plan

### If Workers Migration Fails

1. **Immediate Rollback**: Reassign custom domain back to Pages
2. **Code Rollback**: Revert to React 18 + Next.js 14 if needed
3. **CI/CD Rollback**: Restore Pages deployment pipeline
4. **Validation**: Confirm all functionality restored

### Rollback Timeline

- **Domain Rollback**: 5-15 minutes (DNS propagation)
- **Code Rollback**: 10-30 minutes (git revert + redeploy)
- **Full System Restoration**: 30-60 minutes maximum

## Living Documentation Requirements

### Audit Trail Entries Required

1. **Every Configuration Change**: wrangler.toml, next.config.js, package.json
2. **Every Deployment Step**: Commands executed, results observed
3. **Every Error Encountered**: Full error message, resolution attempted
4. **Domain Migration**: Exact steps, timing, DNS propagation results
5. **Performance Observations**: Before/after metrics, user experience notes

### Failed Attempts Documentation

- **Preserve as footnotes**: Don't delete failed approaches
- **Include reasoning**: Why the approach was tried and why it failed
- **Reference solutions**: Link to successful approaches used instead

### Cross-Repository Value

Document for template users:

- **Environment variable patterns**: How to sync secrets across platforms
- **Domain migration process**: Step-by-step infrastructure changes
- **Worker configuration**: Reusable wrangler.toml templates
- **Testing methodology**: Validation approaches for Workers deployment

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Areas

1. **Domain Cutover**: DNS propagation delays
   - **Mitigation**: Test on workers.dev subdomain first
2. **Package Conflicts**: Third-party React 19 incompatibility
   - **Mitigation**: Use --legacy-peer-deps, document all conflicts
3. **Log Worker Integration**: Communication pattern changes
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, API contract validation

### Medium Risk Areas

1. **Performance Differences**: Workers vs Pages behavior
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive performance testing
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Deployment process changes
   - **Mitigation**: Test deployment pipeline before domain switch

### Low Risk Areas

1. **SSL Certificate**: Cloudflare auto-management
2. **Environment Variables**: Existing sync system handles transition
3. **Rollback Capability**: Pages deployment preserved
