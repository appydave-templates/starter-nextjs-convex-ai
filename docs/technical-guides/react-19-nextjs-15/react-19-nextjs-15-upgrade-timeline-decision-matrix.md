# React 19 Upgrade Timeline & Decision Matrix

**Created**: 2025-08-07  
**Context**: Post-Story 1.10 strategic planning  
**Purpose**: Guide timing and approach for React 19 adoption

> üìã **Navigation**: This document is part of comprehensive React 19 upgrade research. See [React 19 + Next.js 15 Upgrade Research Index](react-19-nextjs-15-upgrade-research-index.md) for complete documentation suite navigation.

## Executive Summary

This decision matrix helps determine the optimal timing and approach for React 19 adoption based on project constraints, infrastructure preferences, and risk tolerance. Three primary strategies are analyzed with detailed timelines and decision criteria.

**Quick Recommendation**: **UPDATED 2025-08-08** - Immediate migration to Cloudflare Workers is now the preferred strategy. Ecosystem has matured significantly with OpenNext adapter stability and React 19 RC reliability improvements. Tony's enthusiasm for React 19 features (Actions, use() hook, optimistic UI) provides strong business justification for immediate upgrade.

### Latest Research Findings (August 2025)

**OpenNext Cloudflare Adapter Maturity**: `@opennextjs/cloudflare` now provides full Node.js runtime support on Workers, supporting all Next.js 15 features with React 19 compatibility. This eliminates the static export limitations that previously blocked the upgrade.

**React 19 Ecosystem Stability**: While still RC, React 19 has reached production stability for core features. Package conflicts can be resolved with `--legacy-peer-deps`, and the Next.js team has expressed confidence in React 19 stability.

**Tony's Feature Requirements**: Business stakeholder enthusiasm for React 19 features including:

- Server Actions for simplified form handling
- `use()` hook for conditional data fetching
- Built-in optimistic UI for better user experience
- Native metadata management
- Performance improvements and smaller bundle sizes
